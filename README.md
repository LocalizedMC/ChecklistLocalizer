# Checklist Localizer
Make Checklist Mod support task localization!

### You can localize it in the following ways:

First, create a new language file (e.g. `en_us.json`).

Then you can use the text contents of `tasks.txt` as a translation key to write the language file. As shown below:
```json
{
  "Example Title": "Localized Title",
  "Task 1": "Localized Task 1",
  "Task 2": "Localized Task 2"
}
```

Finally you'll be able to load it into the resource pack and load the resource pack in the game.
